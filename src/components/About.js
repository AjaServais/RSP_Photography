                    <p style={textStyle}>Robert Servais is a lifestyle, landscape and wedding photographer based in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. I photograph engagement and family sessions in addition to private functions and corporate events. Destination weddings and commercial bookings are available for travel within Canada and destinations worldwide on a limited basis. <br /><br /> I am now booking for Summer/Fall 2017 photo sessions and encourage you to get in touch ahead of time to ensure availability. Booking dates are on a first-come-first-serve basis. Furthermore, booking early also helps work with you and your wedding day schedule to make sure your photographs turn out perfect!  I can also provide recommendations for vendors that Iâ€™ve worked with in the past who do an exceptional job.<br /><br />
              Thank you for your interest in my work,<br/> Robert</p>
